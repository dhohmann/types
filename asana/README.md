# Asana Client Types
Refers to the Asana Client implementation in Javascript ([node-asana](https://github.com/Asana/node-asana/)). As the type definitions did not match, I looked into the isssue. There are some other client implementations, that do the same thing, but do not follow the online documentation.

## Plan to update/maintain
Basically none. To be safe, you should use other API implementation like [asana-sdk](https://github.com/pliancy/asana-sdk).
